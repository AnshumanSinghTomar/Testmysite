<h3> Chikitsak Mobile Application:</h3>
Chikitsak is a user-friendly healthcare mobile app designed to simplify appointment booking and pharmacy location.<br>
It enables patients to easily schedule, reschedule, or cancel doctor appointments from their smartphones, reducing<br>
wait times and improving healthcare access. For healthcare providers, Chikitsak streamlines outpatient department (OPD)<br>
management by allowing doctors to view daily appointments and digitally record prescriptions in real-time.<br><br>
One of the app's standout features is its nearby pharmacy finder, which helps users quickly locate pharmacies close to<br>
their location to get prescribed medicines without hassle. Chikitsak also supports secure digital storage of medical<br>
records and test reports, making health information accessible whenever needed.<br>
With a focus on convenience, efficiency, and data privacy, Chikitsak connects <br><br>
patients and healthcare providers seamlessly, improving the overall healthcare experience.<br>
Whether you're a patient looking to manage appointments effortlessly or a healthcare <br>
professional aiming to optimize your practice, Chikitsak makes healthcare easier and more accessible.
